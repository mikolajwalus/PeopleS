<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

PeopleS that I created is inspired by a world-renowned Facebook app. I’ve treated it as a challenge to test my skills and to expand them further. 
I present you a web application which provides its users with functionalities such as:

- creating and modifying the user’s account with personal information
- making friends and building social networks
- looking over profiles of other users
- scrolling through the main page containing posts published by the user’s friends
- searching other users and making contact with them

# Content presentation

## Register and login forms

Implemented forms to standard register and login procedures.

## User profile and editing

The user can easily edit his/her profile. For instance, he or she can change passwords or other personal information. 
Moreover, there is also a form which enables uploading new profile photos.

## User post creating and browsing

User can easly create new post. With the "infinite scroll" he can also easly browse the post and this solution is good for backend application in case of efficiency.

## User searching and sending "friend" invitation

The user can search for others by means of the search engine. He or she can send them invitations. What is more, he or she can also preview invitations sent to and by him/her. He or she can always see people that currently belong to his/her community of friends.

## Texting users

Another functionality provides texting other users. Again, the use of infinite scroll  is dedicated to the efficiency-focused approach.
